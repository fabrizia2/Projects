### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://ajigala.github.io/sunnyside/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt about grid. Grid helps the website to be responsive and also ensure that divs are well arranged

Code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>We are Creative</h1>
```

```css
.main {
  display: grid;
}
```

```js
const sidebarShow ()=> {
  navlink.classlist.toggle("showned");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to practice more on my CSS grid usage. It best for making a web responsive
